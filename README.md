# HW2Q3

1. Data Representation
The `table_1` and `table_2` variables hold what appears to be training and validation datasets, respectively. Each record (tuple) within these tables has four attributes:
- Education level (e.g., College, High School)
- Job sector (e.g., Management, Service)
- Experience (e.g., Less than 3 years, More than 10 years)
- A class label indicating a certain category (e.g., High, Low)

2. Functions
   - `calculate_probability`:
        - Calculates the conditional probability of a feature value given a class.
            -By implementing the Laplace smoothing to handle zero frequencies by adding 1 to the feature count and 2 to the class count.
               - This approach ensures every feature has a non-zero probability
          
   - Parameters:
     - `feature_value` - the specific value of the feature
     -  `feature_index` - the position of the feature within an instance tuple
     - `class_value` - the class for which the probability is calculated
     - `data` 
   
2. `calculate_class_probability`:
   - Computes the probability of each class within the dataset,
       using Laplace smoothing by adding 1 to the count for the class and 2 to the overall dataset length.
   
3. `classify`:
   - Given an instance and a dataset, this function calculates the probability of the instance belonging to each class.
       - It multiplies the class probability with the conditional probabilities of all feature values given the class.
       - It returns the class with the highest probability as the predicted class.
   - Parameter:
       - `instance` the instance to classify
       - `dataset` the dataset used for computing probabilities.
   
4. Loop through Validation Data:
   - Iterates over each instance in the validation dataset (`table_2`),
   - classifies it using the `classify` function, and prints the result.

5. Classifier Logic
   - uses a Naive Bayes approach
   - practices Laplace smoothing to prevent multiplication by zero when calculating probabilities.
   - By applying these probabilities for class prediction by multiplying the likelihoods of all features given a class and selecting the class with the highest calculated 
     probability.

6. Key Aspects and Considerations:
   -  Laplace Smoothing - is critical in this implementation,
         - ensuring that unseen features in the training data don't zero out an entire class's probability.
- Only the first three features of each instance are considered during the classification process, as indicated by `range(3)` in the loop within the `classify` function.
   it assumes the equal importance of weight of all features and independence among them given the class label
